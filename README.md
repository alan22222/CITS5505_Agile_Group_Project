## Purpose, Design and use
This application is a powerful data analysis tool designed to simplify the process of identifying the most suitable machine learning model for any dataset with just one click. 

Users can register and log in to access a user-friendly dashboard. From there, they can upload datasets in CSV format, which are validated before proceeding. Once validated, users can select a machine learning model and processing speed. The backend processes the data and provides detailed insights and analysis.

Currently, the app supports three core machine learning models: Linear Regression, SVM, and K-Means, along with three processing speed options.
 
 
 ## Instruction of launching the app
1. Ensure python3 is supported in the running machine.
2. Install virtual environment using the cmd line: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment using the cmd line: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the required packages using the cmd line: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the following cmd line and open the app with the shown link: `python run.py` (the link should be shown in something that is similar to "* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000")

## Instuction of running the tests for the app
